<p>In my travels up and down Germany, I often pass by the Karlsruhe train station. My train stops, I never have gotten out, and depending on where my train is I have seen this wall of text. It does not look like an advertisement, and it caught my eye multiple times before I finally managed to read it. It simply says,</p>
<p><em>Ich bin ein Individuum.</em></p>
<p><em>Weit mehr als jede ausgedachte Figur aus irgendeiner Erzählung.</em></p>
<p><em>Ich atme. Ich fühle. Ich lebe. Und das jeden Tag.</em></p>
<p><em>Ich esse. Ich arbeite. Ich schlafe. Ich bin wie Du.</em></p>
<p><em>Ich renne. Ich springe. Ich klettere und fliehe. Ich stelle mich. Ich schreie.</em></p>
<p><em>Ich erschaffe und zerstöre. Ich mache das, weil ich es machen kann.</em></p>
<p><em>Und das mein Leben lang.</em></p>
<p>My rough translation,</p>
<p><em>I am an individual.</em></p>
<p><em>Further beyond any concieved Figure from any tale.</em></p>
<p><em>I breathe. I feel. I live. And that every day.</em></p>
<p><em>I eat. I work. I sleep. I am like you.</em></p>
<p><em>I run. I jump. I climb and run away. I confront. I scream.</em></p>
<p><em>I create and destroy. I do that, because I can do it.</em></p>
<p><em>And that, all my life.</em></p>
<p>I always wondered what it was and why it was there. Reading it sometime around the immigration crisis in Germany around 2015, it was to me a strong reminder of what it is to be human - and why it is so - <strong>just because</strong>.</p>
<p>Some basic duckduckgo’ing revealed further information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The wall on Platform 1 is an <a href="https://m.karlsruhe.de/kunst/db/de/schriftbild.html/">art installation</a> by Berlin artists Wermke/Leinkauf.</p></li>
<li><p>The wall and the poetry upon it is also mentioned in <a href="http://stephan-teuber.de/unerwartete-poesie-beim-umsteigen">this</a> blog post (in German). Below picture taken from the same blog post.</p></li>

Human brain and evolution

<p>In my recent discussions with some of my friends I have repeatedly come upon this insight that the human brains have remained unchanged for over 30,000 years (at least) i.e. the hunter gatherer humans, Vedic peoples, Huns, Romans etc. have had the same brains with the same cognitive abilities as we did. I find this idea to be amazing because it has a lot of implications on how we currently view and understand things. I came across this idea first from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGiQaabX3_o">Kurzgesagt</a> video talking about human origins. They say that we could go back approximately 50,000 years ago, kidnap a human baby and raise it without noticing any difference in today’s world. But, some research into this makes this more interesting.</p>
<p>Evolution of anatomically modern humans <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens#Anatomical_modernity">ASH</a> have been estimated to be over 300,000 years ago, with latest estimates of humans showing gracile features from around 50,000-30,000 years ago. This <a href="https://www.mpg.de/11322481/oldest-homo-sapiens-fossils-at-jebel-irhoud-morocco">report</a> by the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology pushes back the origin of modern humans by 100,000 years to over 300,000 years ago, i.e. fossils with the same facial characteristics as modern humans have been documented from this time. While the body of the modern humans have been identified, researchers citing a newer <a href="https://www.mpg.de/11883269/homo-sapiens-brain-evolution">finding</a> say that the modern human brain continued to evolve along with the Homo Sapiens lineage and that only fossils less than 35,000 years ago show the same cranial shape as that of humans today.</p>
<p>Information about humans from very long ago is typically confirmed using various paleo-archaeological methods, the most common among them being:</p>
<p>— measurements obtained from hominid findings</p>
<p>— genetic analysis of both remains and present day humans</p>
<p>— evolutionary observations from other animals</p>
<p>These are typically combined with anthropology, linguistics, geography and environmental studies to form a more complete picture.</p>
<p>Further, it is known that humans are still <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/news/human-brain-still-evolving">evolving</a>. Genetic mutations in humans continue to occur, some of which lead to long term changes in the species. One such mutation related to brain size has been identified in certain populations from around 5,800 years ago. These indicate that human brain size (cranial volume) has actually reduced. This nice <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/if-modern-humans-are-so-smart-why-are-our-brains-shrinking">article</a> describes how our brains are changing in different ways. While humans today have slightly smaller brains, it is difficult to ascertain if there have been any changes in intelligence itself. There have been attempts to explain this reduction in brain size with various theories. Some of them as described in the above article are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Global warming and the reduction in the polar ice caps lead to a warmer planet and thus pushed all animal life to reduce body size that also lead to a reduction in the brain size.</p></li>
<li><p>Increasing social complexity lead to task specialisation that in turn reduced the need for individual humans to expend energy in trying to maintain a bigger brain.</p></li>
<li><p>It has been observed that domestication leads to a smaller brain. Domesticated dogs have a smaller brain than their wolf ancestors but show intelligence on different levels. The idea is that human could have domesticated themselves leading to a smaller brain in the process. One of the aspects of this is also reduced aggression, with humans today supposedly being far less aggressive than humans 10,000 years ago. Reduced aggression coupled with co-operation and communication lead us to what we are today.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Irrespective of what caused the reduction in brain size, we can therefore gain the following main insights:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Modern day humans with a similar and stable genetic and anatomical structures can be found up to 30,000 years ago.</p></li>
<li><p>There have been very small changes in human brain size from around 5800 years ago. Humans 10,000 years ago had slightly bigger brains that we do today, but it is difficult to ascertain if there have been any changes in intelligence and that is because intelligence itself is difficult to define.</p></li>
<li><p>Stable genetic mutations have been observed in certain populations of humans over the past 5,000-10,000 years. These mutations such as those involving blue eyes, lactose intolerance, sickle cell anaemia etc. have been observed but we do not know yet if they are stable evolutionary changes because of the long time frame necessary for evolutionary changes to occur.</p></li>
<li><p>It is safe to assume that, on average, humans up to 5,000 years ago (after reduction in brain size) had similar brains as we do today. That time is the beginning of civilisations, organised religion and kingdoms, approximately 5,000 years after humans started farming and built cities.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now I think that implication of these insights are what is most interesting^. They are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>People back then (5,000 years ago) had the same brains, and hence the same thoughts, feelings, cognitive abilities and emotions as we did. They possibly interacted with each other in very similar ways. The only things that have changed are the availability of a range of information and technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>Valid principles, concepts and methods established back throughout human history, when based on observations of human brain and behaviour might then still hold true. This would include social systems, religions, administrative policies and psychological tactics.</p></li>
<li><p>Empirical knowledge based on the hitherto unchanged human brain and behaviour would still be valid.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I found this realisation quite humbling. To think, that the main thoughts of a Roman soldier standing guard in a remote German outpost would have been those of food and a warm bath or that the ancient Harappan peoples approached difficult problems with the same cognitive tools as we have today. This could also mean that observations made by thinkers such as the Buddha on the human behaviour and how to cope with them would scientifically still be applicable today. What could this mean for modern psychology?</p>
<p><em>^ Here I make a relatively harmless assumption (I think) that brain and behaviour are closely linked, and that similar brains lead to similar behaviours. While this is true in general, it is important to say that we do not know in detail all the variables that are involved. Could the behaviour of humans a few thousand years ago be completely different from that of today due to some external environmental factors that we do know of?</em></p>

Catching Comet Neowise

<p>An older write-up from July 22, 2020.</p>
<p>The comet NEOWISE (named after the NEOWISE mission of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) space telescope) is near earth and I got a chance to see it. Living where I live, the weather is always a big issue and for most of the comet’s viewing duration there was heavy cloud cover. The comet is a rare naked-eye comet that was expected to dazzle viewers after the great show provided by Hale-Bopp in 1997 that I remember seeing so clearly when I was younger. It did not dazzle everyone as much, but was quite exciting anyway.</p>
<p>The comet peaked on the horizon on the 21st of July and could be visible directly below the Ursa Major constellation - directly below the middle star of the ladle it creates.</p>

<p>The hazy streak to the right is the comet and I was surprised at even having caught it because there was a lot of pollution from the light. The second attempt a more organized one at a nearby meadow and the pictures look better.</p>

<p>The exposure was a little longer since I could see the stars starting to trail. And some more pictures for good measure.</p>

<p>I am starting this blog to collect a random assortment of my thoughts, ideas and experiments. Previously I have used <a href="https://telegra.ph">telegra.ph</a> to write short excerpts that I shared with friends, this blog is a means to bring it all together in one place.</p>
<p>The blog is written in markdown, published using <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">bashblog</a> and hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>. The motivation behind this approach is to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Stay minimal.</li>
<li>Create an independent, bloat-free corner of the world wide web.</li>
<li>Learn how to best do all this.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here we go.</p>
