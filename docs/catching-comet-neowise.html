<p>An older write-up from July 22, 2020.</p>
<p>The comet NEOWISE (named after the NEOWISE mission of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) space telescope) is near earth and I got a chance to see it. Living where I live, the weather is always a big issue and for most of the comet’s viewing duration there was heavy cloud cover. The comet is a rare naked-eye comet that was expected to dazzle viewers after the great show provided by Hale-Bopp in 1997 that I remember seeing so clearly when I was younger. It did not dazzle everyone as much, but was quite exciting anyway.</p>
<p>The comet peaked on the horizon on the 21st of July and could be visible directly below the Ursa Major constellation - directly below the middle star of the ladle it creates.</p>

<p>The hazy streak to the right is the comet and I was surprised at even having caught it because there was a lot of pollution from the light. The second attempt a more organized one at a nearby meadow and the pictures look better.</p>

<p>The exposure was a little longer since I could see the stars starting to trail. And some more pictures for good measure.</p>
