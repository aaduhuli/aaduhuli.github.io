Catching Comet Neowise
</title><description><![CDATA[
<style>body {text-align: justify}</style>
<p>An older write-up from July 22, 2020.</p>
<p>The comet NEOWISE (named after the NEOWISE mission of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) space telescope) is near earth and I got a chance to see it. Living where I live, the weather is always a big issue and for most of the cometâ€™s viewing duration there was heavy cloud cover. The comet is a rare naked-eye comet that was expected to dazzle viewers after the great show provided by Hale-Bopp in 1997 that I remember seeing so clearly when I was younger. It did not dazzle everyone as much, but was quite exciting anyway.</p>
<p>The comet peaked on the horizon on the 21st of July and could be visible directly below the Ursa Major constellation - directly below the middle star of the ladle it creates.</p>

<p>The hazy streak to the right is the comet and I was surprised at even having caught it because there was a lot of pollution from the light. The second attempt a more organized one at a nearby meadow and the pictures look better.</p>

<p>The exposure was a little longer since I could see the stars starting to trail. And some more pictures for good measure.</p>

Introduction
</title><description><![CDATA[
<style>body {text-align: justify}</style>
<p>I am starting this blog to collect a random assortment of my thoughts, ideas and experiments. Previously I have used <a href="https://telegra.ph">telegra.ph</a> to write short excerpts that I shared with friends, this blog is a means to bring it all together in one place.</p>
<p>The blog is written in markdown, published using <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog">bashblog</a> and hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>. The motivation behind this approach is to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Stay minimal.</li>
<li>Create an independent, bloat-free corner of the world wide web.</li>
<li>Learn how to best do all this.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here we go.</p>
