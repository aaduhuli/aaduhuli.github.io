One of the things I love about India is its diversity - and what tastier representation of diversity than that of bananas. 

Growing up in South India, I took all the different varieties of bananas for granted. Only when I was exposed to years of monoculture [Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_banana) bananas in Europe did I truly begin to appreciate what I had. 

Below is a table of some varieties I know with their local names for reference. 

|     |     | | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Cavendish banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_banana) | Most common variety found in supermarkets in US/EU. | Generic banana, paccha baale hannu | 
| [Dwarf Cavendish banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Cavendish_banana) | | paccha baale hannu | 
| Musa AB cultivar / Musa sp. var. elakki baale | South Indian indigenous variety | elakki baale hannu | 
| N/A | | rasa baale hannu | 
| Nendran variety | | Nendran baale hannu | 
| N/A | | Kaadu baale (similar to pacca baale but slightly sour) | 

I hope to expand this table as I learn more about the different varieties some day.

Three different varieties of bananas in the above picture with the smallest one being elakki baale (also in bunch). I could only find [one reference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21476022/) to the elakki baale hannu where they refer to it as simply Musa sp. var. elakki baale. This is my favourite variety, it's sweet and flavourful in a way that hardly compares to the Cavenish variety.
