This is my blog, a set of disparate ideas that may have no right to be here and yet have nowhere else to be. 

The blog is named after an ancient South Indian game known in English as [Lambs and Tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambs_and_Tigers). It is an assymmetric game involving spatial math where one player controls three tigers (huli) and the other controls a maximum of 15 goats (AaDu / meke). Even today in the old stone forts and temples of South India one can see markings in the stone where people played this game.
