Hello world.

Switching this blog to jekyll from bashblog. It is much cleaner and provides a variety of potential features for the future.

24.07.2024
Switched this blog to using hexo from jekyll. Trying out various Static Site Generators to see which suits my workflow the most. This switch however enables me to publish directly from joplin which is a big plus.
