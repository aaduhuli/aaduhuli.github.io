In the movie [Boothayyana Maga Ayyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhootayyana_Maga_Ayyu), there is a character called Siddi Byra, who is of African origin. I had always wondered what he was doing there of all places until I recently learned about the [Siddis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddis_of_Karnataka), an ethnic group of African origin in the Indian subcontinent.

Siddhis were primarily brought to India as mercenaries by Indian Sultans or as slaves by Europeans in the 15th-16th centuries. The community is [especially strong in Karnataka](https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122614/http://www.deccanherald.com/archives/mar202005/n1.asp) although there are pockets spread throughtout the subcontinent.

There are stories of these soldiers rising up to become generals and sometimes even rulers at various times. One famous figure being [Malik Amber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY9RIGEWD_o) from Ethiopia who ruled the Deccan for a while.
