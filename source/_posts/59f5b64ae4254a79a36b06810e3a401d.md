Here is a list of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) that I use as of today. I hope it helps others who are looking to switch to open source alternatives make their decisions.

**Hardware**

I primarily use a macbook pro (running Mojave) from work as my main machine along with a personal iphone. Apart from that I have a few raspberry pi's and one lonely beaglebone (both running Debian) for doing odd tasks.

**Software**
