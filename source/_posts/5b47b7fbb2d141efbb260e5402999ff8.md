RSS or [Really Simple Syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is a way to access and read web content in a standard format. It is a simple way to read and follow web content in a highly specific passive form without any influence of advertisements or algorithms.

News, Youtube channels, blogs, podcasts, web comics - you can follow them all using RSS. There are many RSS clients out there but I can recommend [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) for macos/ios users and good old [Thunderbird](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-subscribe-news-feeds-and-blogs) for everyone else.

The merits of RSS have been [described elsewhere](https://atthis.link/blog/2021/rss.html) over the internet and I will not go into it here. All I can say is, it is awesome.

## Using RSS to follow latest scientific research on pubmed

1. Go to pubmed and define your search using the various Advanced parameters available.
2. Click on `Create RSS` link below the search bar to create an RSS feed for the given search. An RSS feed is created.
   ![create\_rss](https://i.ibb.co/D1YbkXn/create-rss.png)
3. Now, the feed URL can be copied and imported into any client.
   ![get\_feed\_url](https://i.ibb.co/1bKg9YJ/get-feed-url.png)

The RSS client will now show the latest articles based on the search terms that can be easily followed.
