This post is a nostalgic reminder of a shaving product by Godrej that has since been discontinued. The simple round tab of shaving soap came in a small plastic box as shown below as well as in paper boxes for refills. It was good soap, lasted forever, included minimal packaging, was eco-friendly and cheap - everything I look for in a consumer product.

It is not longer available taken off the shelves probably due to a lack of demand or because it was no longer profitable to sell these. It follows a long line of products that have now been replaced by more consumerist ones.

Here is [another forum post](https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/farewell-godrej-shave-round.625601/) bidding farewell to this gem of a user product.
